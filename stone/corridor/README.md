Edge corridor tiles
===========

Dungeon corridor tiles designed to be compatible with Dwarven Forge dungeon tiles.

This set of corridors are designed with their backs in the same style and positino as dwarven forge walls.  Because this uses up playable area, x1 corrridords are not included as the sspace between the walls is only a few mm.  I have serious doubts as to the usability of the x2 corridords, but have included them as theya re still wide enough to hold standard minis.  x3 & x4 are both very usable.

Stone
-----

Currently there are 12 stone corridor tiles in every size from 1x2 to 4x4.

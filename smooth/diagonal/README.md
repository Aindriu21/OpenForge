Diagonal tiles
============

Dungeon diagonal tiles designed to be compatible with Dwarven Forge dungeon tiles.

I've created the smooth set as a way of designing the basic form of the tiles that I intend for all other sets.  These tiles can be used as concrete, ice, dirt, or painted to really be any type of tile, as they have no printed decoration.

Smooth
------

Currently there are 4 smooth diagonal tiles and 4 smooth diagonal half floor tiles in equal size from 1x1 to 4x4.

Corner tiles
============

Dungeon edge corner tiles designed to be compatible with Dwarven Forge dungeon tiles.

I've created the concrete set as a way of designing the basic form of the tiles that I intend for all other sets.  These tiles can be used as concrete, or painted to really be any type of tile, as they have no printed decoration.

Concrete
--------

Currently there are 4 concrete/plain edge corner tiles in equal size from 1x1 to 4x4.
